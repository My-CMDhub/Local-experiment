## 🚀 How to Run Locally
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/localexperiment.git
   cd localexperiment
   ```
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
   - No build step needed (pure HTML/CSS/JS)
   - For best results, use a local server (e.g. VSCode Live Server, Python's `http.server`)

---

## 🌐 Deployment
- Deploy as a static site (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)
- Ensure your homepage is `index.html` and all links use `/` or relative paths
- All assets are local; no backend required
